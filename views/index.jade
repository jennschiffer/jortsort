  #why
    .info
      h4 Sorting is broken.

      ul
        li they can literally take forever to run
        li there are so many algorithms to choose from
        li we have to write more code, which means inefficiency

  
  #what(data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5")
    .info.stellar
      h2 jortSort isn't a sorting algorithm. It's a sorting <em>toolset</em>.

      .box
        ul
          li makes the user do the work (this is what recursion means, for you non-degree holders)
          li guarantees efficiency because you don't have to sort ever again

  #how
    .info
      h4 How does jortSort work?

      p jortSort checks if your inputs are sorted. If they aren't then you can let the user know they fucked up.

      h2 Where can you get jortSort?

      .box
        ul
          li: a(href="http://github.com/jennschiffer/jortsort") http://github.com/jennschiffer/jortsort
          li: a(href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS") `Rx.Observable.jortSort()` and `Rx.Observable.jortSortUntil(other)` now in RxJS thanks to Matthew Podwysocki of Microsoft's Open Tech team!
